## Operating system 
- MacOS with m1 chip
- Google Colab to run extensions
- PyCharm IDE

## Running the executable and extensions
- Run `task1.py`, `task2.py`, `task3.py`, `task4.py` in PyCharm IDE or the command line.
- If you have Google Colab subscription and want to run the `extension ipynb file`, you can upload the data and model files to the proper directory and use GPU to run the first extension and TPU to run the second extension. Otherwise, if you don't want to run but just want to see the result, you can simply open the notebook file in DataShell IDE or Jupyter Notebook and see the run results.
- Before you run, install all the packages with this: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
